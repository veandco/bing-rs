# Bing API for Rust

This is currently still a work-in-progress. Ignore this library for now!

# Example
First, you must set the _SUBSCRIPTION_KEY_ environment variable to the key you got from Bing. If you're using Custom Speech API, you must also set _ENDPOINT_ID_.

After that, you can try the examples by running `cargo run --example simple` or `cargo run --example detailed`!
